# Hi there 👋  

**Alea Minar** | She/Her/Hers  
Recent **Computer Science graduate from the University of Oregon**

I’m currently mentoring and programming with FIRST Robotics Team 5468 for the 2026 season while applying to graduate programs in robotics and autonomous systems. I’m interested in robotics, computer vision, and machine learning.

I enjoy interdisciplinary work and love taking projects from concept to implementation. Whether it’s building a digital twin with real-time sensor input, simulating robotics systems, or designing data visualizations, my ideal project requires end-to-end problem solving and teaches me something new.

Long term, I’m excited about autonomous systems and would love to work on dynamic fleets of rovers; Systems that coordinate, adapt, and operate intelligently in complex environments.
